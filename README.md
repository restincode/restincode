# RestInCode (RIC)

https://restincode.com

## A memorial site for Hackers and InfoSec people who have passed.

RIC is a memorial site for Hackers and Information Security people who have passed. In a community and industry that many of us see as timeless, we are quickly learning that is not the reality, as our dear friends and colleagues more frequently move on. Our ideals, our research, and our spirit persists. Unfortunately, our human shells can't keep up sometimes. We seek to honor those who have touched security, technology, and our lives.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. We leave this here for the thoughts we want to convey, but can't find the words for it.

## How to contribute

This project is intended to be open to all and a true community effort. Everyone should feel empowered to contribute additional photos, blogs, talks, papers, research, etc for individuals listed.

> **The most significant request we have for contributors** is to help us create the actual person.json file for every individual who has an open Issue ticket. Many people will open an Issue for the deceased, few will take the extra time to create the actual files to populate the site.
>
> Here are some other ways to contribute:
>
> - Updating/improving our website, graphics, and logos (we suck)
> - Writing code to [auto-publish entries](#174) on the anniversary of their passing
> - Prioritize [adding people who are missing](https://github.com/restincode/restincode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acreated-asc+label%3A%22Add+Person%22) from the website, before prioritizing [people who are missing additional data](https://github.com/restincode/restincode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acreated-asc+label%3A%22Add+Data%22+label%3A%22Person+Added%22) to their bio
>
