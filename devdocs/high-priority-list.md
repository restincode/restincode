## Processing Order Rationale

### Start with Tier 1

- Highest community impact
- Good test cases (varying data completeness)
- Likely to receive most attention when PRs created
- Kevin Mitnick should be FIRST (most famous)

### Then Tier 2

- Well-known in community
- L0pht group members (can batch process similar people)
- Good data available

### Then Tier 3

- Fill in remaining notable figures
- Recent deaths (show active maintenance)

### Finally: Remaining Backlog

- Process all other "Add Person" issues
- Handle "Add Data" updates to existing memorials

## Special Considerations

### L0pht Heavy Industries Members

Issues #198, #199, #200, #201 are all L0pht members. Consider:

- Similar data structure
- Could reference each other in bios
- Historical context can be shared
- Might want to coordinate these PRs

### Recent Deaths (2025)

Issues #295, #297, #298 are from 2025:

- Shows site is actively maintained
- May have more accessible data (recent sources)
- Consider processing quickly to demonstrate responsiveness

### Incomplete Data

Some high-profile people have minimal issue data:

- AP Delchi (#298) - minimal info
- Adrian Lamo (#209) - may be controversial
- May require additional research before processing
